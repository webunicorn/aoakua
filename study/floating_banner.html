	The EOS 5D is a 12.8 megapixel digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera body produced by Canon. The EOS 5D was announced by Canon on 22 August 2005,[2] and at the time was priced above the EOS 20D but below the EOS-1D Mark II and EOS-1Ds Mark II in Canon's EOS digital SLR series. The camera accepts EF lens mount lenses.

The EOS 5D is notable for being the first full-frame DSLR camera with a standard body size (as opposed to the taller, double-grip "professional" camera body style). It is also notable for its price, suggested at US$3299 sans lens,[2] which set a significant new low price point for full-frame DSLRs; its only full-frame competition at the time was the Canon 1Ds Mark II, which cost more than twice as much.[3]

On 17 September 2008, Canon announced the camera's successor, the Canon EOS 5D Mark II.[4]

Sensor and image processing[edit]
The 5D has a DIGIC II processor and a 35.8 x 23.9 mm full-frame CMOS sensor with 13.3 million pixels (12.7 megapixel effective) and a pixel density of 1.5 megapixels per square centimetre. ISO speeds from 100 to 1600 are provided, adjustable in 1/3 steps (ISO can be expanded to L: 50 or H: 3200 with a menu function). The ISO 50 setting reduces dynamic range by a stop in the highlights.

Autofocus and metering[edit]
The 5D has nine autofocus points (plus six "invisible assist AF points" available only during continuous-focus tracking) arranged in a horizontal diamond pattern. The AF system was a minor upgrade to the one on the 20D.[citation needed] The camera uses TTL 35-zone SPC metering with four variations (evaluative, center-weighted, partial, spot) and exposure compensation of −2 EV to +2 EV in steps of 1/3 EV.E-TTL II flash metering is provided.

Shutter[edit]
The shutter is rated to 100,000 shots,[5] and is capable of speeds up to 1/8000 sec, with a flash sync speed of 1/200 sec.

Ergonomics[edit]

Back of the Canon EOS 5D camera
The 5D is very similar in design to the 20D, and most of the controls are identical or nearly so. Differences include:

A much larger and brighter pentaprism viewfinder with approx. 96% coverage. This arrangement, borrowed from the 1D range, omits the pop-up flash of the consumer range.
A larger, 230,000 pixel, 2.5" (63 mm) colour TFT liquid-crystal monitor
Speed[edit]
The 5D can shoot up to 3 frames per second, with a buffer that can store up to 60 frames in large JPEG mode, and up to 17 frames in RAW.

Physical dimensions[edit]
Size (LxHxW): 152 x 113 x 75 mm (6.0 x 4.4 x 2.9 in)
Weight (body only w/battery): 895 g

An active-pixel sensor (APS) is an image sensor consisting of an integrated circuit containing an array of pixel sensors, each pixel containing a photodetector and an active amplifier. There are many types of active pixel sensors including the complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) APS used most commonly in cell phone cameras, web cameras, most digital pocket cameras since 2010, and in most digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs). Such an image sensor is produced using CMOS technology (and is hence also known as a CMOS sensor), and has emerged as an alternative to charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors.


CMOS image sensor
The term 'active pixel sensor' is also used to refer to the individual pixel sensor itself, as opposed to the image sensor;[1] in that case the image sensor is sometimes called an active pixel sensor imager,[2] or active-pixel image sensor.[3]

The term active pixel sensor was coined in 1985 by Tsutomu Nakamura who worked on the Charge Modulation Device active pixel sensor at Olympus,[4] and more broadly defined by Eric Fossum in a 1993 paper.[5]

Image sensor elements with in-pixel amplifiers were described by Noble in 1968,[6] by Chamberlain in 1969,[7] and by Weimer et al. in 1969,[8] at a time when passive-pixel sensors – that is, pixel sensors without their own amplifiers or active noise cancelling circuitry – were being investigated as a solid-state alternative to vacuum-tube imaging devices.[citation needed] The MOS passive-pixel sensor used just a simple switch in the pixel to read out the photodiode integrated charge.[9] Pixels were arrayed in a two-dimensional structure, with an access enable wire shared by pixels in the same row, and output wire shared by column. At the end of each column was an amplifier. Passive-pixel sensors suffered from many limitations, such as high noise, slow readout, and lack of scalability. The addition of an amplifier to each pixel addressed these problems, and resulted in the creation of the active-pixel sensor. Noble in 1968 and Chamberlain in 1969 created sensor arrays with active MOS readout amplifiers per pixel, in essentially the modern three-transistor configuration. The CCD was invented in October 1969 at Bell Labs. Because the MOS process was so variable and MOS transistors had characteristics that changed over time (Vth instability), the CCD's charge-domain operation was more manufacturable and quickly eclipsed MOS passive and active pixel sensors. A low-resolution "mostly digital" N-channel MOSFET imager with intra-pixel amplification, for an optical mouse application, was demonstrated in 1981.[10]

Another type of active pixel sensor is the hybrid infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures in the infrared spectrum. The devices are two chips that are put together like a sandwich: one chip contains detector elements made in InGaAs or HgCdTe, and the other chip is typically made of silicon and is used to read out the photodetectors. The exact date of origin of these devices is classified, but by the mid-1980s they were in widespread use.

By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the CMOS process was well established as a well controlled stable process and was the baseline process for almost all logic and microprocessors. There was a resurgence in the use of passive-pixel sensors for low-end imaging applications,[11] and active-pixel sensors for low-resolution high-function applications such as retina simulation[12] and high energy particle detector. However, CCDs continued to have much lower temporal noise and fixed-pattern noise and were the dominant technology for consumer applications such as camcorders as well as for broadcast cameras, where they were displacing video camera tubes.

Eric Fossum, et al., invented the image sensor that used intra-pixel charge transfer along with an in-pixel amplifier to achieve true correlated double sampling (CDS) and low temporal noise operation, and on-chip circuits for fixed-pattern noise reduction, and published the first extensive article[5] predicting the emergence of APS imagers as the commercial successor of CCDs. Between 1993 and 1995, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed a number of prototype devices, which validated the key features of the technology. Though primitive, these devices demonstrated good image performance with high readout speed and low power consumption.

In 1995, personnel from JPL founded Photobit Corp., who continued to develop and commercialize APS technology for a number of applications, such as web cams, high speed and motion capture cameras, digital radiography, endoscopy (pill) cameras, DSLRs and camera-phones. Many other small image sensor companies also sprang to life shortly thereafter due to the accessibility of the CMOS process and all quickly adopted the active pixel sensor approach. Most recent, the CMOS sensor technology has spread to medium-format photography with Phase One being the first to launch a medium format digital back with a Sony-built CMOS sensor.
